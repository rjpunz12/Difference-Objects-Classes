Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the structure and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from them will have. Think of a class as a generic description of something.

Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class. When you create an object, you're creating something tangible (in the programming world) that can perform the actions and hold the data defined by its class.

Class Example: Think of a "Car" class that defines properties like color, make, and model, and methods like start() or drive().
Object Example: A specific car, say a red Toyota Corolla, is an object of the "Car" class.
# Difference Between Objects and Classes

## Definition

- **Class**: A blueprint that defines the structure (properties) and behaviors (methods) that objects of this class will have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a tangible entity with its own unique data.

## Java Code Explanation

This Java program demonstrates the differences between objects and classes by defining a `Car` class and creating two `Car` objects (instances). Each object has its own specific data, but they share the same class blueprint.

### Example Code:
```java
class Car {
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;
    
    Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
    
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Car: " + make + " " + model + " (" + year + ")");
    }
    
    void startCar() {
        System.out.println("The car is starting...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
        Car car2 = new Car("Ford", "Mustang", 1967);
        
        car1.displayInfo();
        car2.displayInfo();
        
        car1.startCar();
        car2.startCar();
    }
}
